## 1. Intent (Purpose of This Document)

This document is **not** a protocol proposal or a product specification.

It is an exploration of whether **experience-based decision-making** can be formalized as a **reusable structure**

without collapsing into “correct answers” or a single, authoritative solution.

Rather than treating experience as advice or conclusions, this document examines whether the *act of deciding*, grounded in lived experience, can be represented in a structured and shareable form while preserving contextual plurality.

In particular, this document explicitly seeks critique and feedback on the following points:

- Whether **Decision Question** can be considered a valid primitive (minimal unit) for representing decision-making
- Whether **ASV (Attestation / Shared Validation)** genuinely avoids ranking, scoring, or hierarchical dynamics
- At what points this model would break down or reach its limits in real-world operation

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Why Existing Q&A and Knowledge-Sharing Systems Are Insufficient

In today’s information environment,

while there is an abundance of **“correct answers”** and **success stories**,

there is a structural gap in how people determine **which options fit their own situation** and translate that judgement into action.

Most existing Q&A and knowledge-sharing systems primarily focus on:

- outcomes (answers / best practices)
- generalized knowledge
- ranking or prioritization through voting and evaluation

However, they rarely preserve the **structure of decision-making itself**, including:

- the **context** in which a judgement became valid
- the assumptions and constraints under which a choice was made
- why alternative options were not selected
- **what new context emerged as a result of that judgement**

As a result, even when information exists,

it often cannot be referenced in a way that makes

**“what should I do next?”** *judgable* within one’s own context.

---

### Difference in Scope Compared to InfoFi

While **InfoFi** primarily addresses:

**the valuation, prediction, and marketization of information**,

PoX focuses on an earlier and more fundamental stage:

**the state in which judgement itself cannot yet be formed.**

Accordingly, this document does **not** address InfoFi-style mechanisms such as correctness evaluation, pricing, or value computation.

Instead, it focuses on the structural question of:

**how judgability is generated, and how it can be shared**,

prior to evaluation, prediction, or market dynamics.

---

## 3. Core Idea

### Treating Experience as a Set of Options, Not as “Answers”

PoX treats experience-based decision-making

not as the presentation of a single “correct answer” or prescriptive advice,

but as a structured way to surface and share **options**.

Specifically, PoX is a framework designed to:

> for a given Decision Question (a question oriented toward taking action),
> 
> 
> construct and share a **context-validated set of options**,
> 
> thereby making the uncertainty inherent in that question explicit and visible.
> 

The basic flow is as follows:

**Decision Question → Option → Attestation → Fork**

---

**① Decision Question**

A question that arises from a state in which action cannot be chosen

due to context-dependent indeterminacy.

**② Option**

An experience-based option, presented in relation to a specific Decision Question,

with its relevant context explicitly attached.

**③ Attestation**

A context-aware statement of validity regarding an Option,

expressing how and under what conditions it holds.

**④ Fork (a new Will emerging from context)**

A divergence or reinterpretation generated by differences in context,

resulting in a new direction or Decision Question.

---

## 4. What PoX Is NOT

- ❌ A system for determining “correct” answers
- ❌ A voting-, ranking-, or evaluation-based hierarchy
- ❌ A market for predicting or betting on the future
- ❌ A mechanism for overturning or invalidating past decisions

PoX does **not** aim to produce a single correct answer,

nor to evaluate or rank people or decisions based on outcomes.

## What PoX **Is**

PoX is a **decision-making infrastructure** that preserves

**contextualized decision paths**,

allowing others to compare them against their own situations,

reuse them where applicable,

or branch (fork) into new paths based on contextual differences.

---

# 5. Conceptual Flow

— A Decision Graph Centered on Decision Questions —

## Purpose

In PoX, this section illustrates—in temporal order—

**how experience-based decisions are generated, validated, fixed, reused, and branched**,

making explicit both **user actions** and **state transitions** within the system.

---

## Roles

- **Initiator**
    
    The person who raises a **Decision Question (DQ)**
    
- **Proposer**
    
    The person who presents an **Option** in response to a DQ
    
- **Attestor**
    
    The person who observes an Option and its Context and issues an **attestation** (a contextual stance)
    
- **Forker**
    
    The person who creates a **Fork** by branching from an existing Option under a new context
    
- **Observer**
    
    The person who only views, compares, or references Options
    
    (does not participate in ASV)
    

---

## Overall Flow (Chronological)

### Step 1 | Decision Question Creation

**Action**

- The Initiator explicitly states a question oriented toward taking action

**Input**

- Personal uncertainty / intent / situation

**Output**

- Decision Question (DQ)
- DQ hash / metadata

**State**

- DQ: `Open`

---

### Step 2 | Option Submission

**Action**

- A Proposer submits an Option in response to a DQ
- Each Option is accompanied by a minimal **Context** (assumptions / constraints)

**Input**

- DQ
- Experience-based option proposal

**Output**

- Option v0
- Context v0
- Content-addressed hash

**State**

- Option: `Draft → Proposed`

---

### Step 3 | ASV (Attestation-style Validation)

**ASV is NOT:**

- a vote to determine correctness
- a ranking weighted by reputation or influence
- a mechanism to converge opinions into one conclusion

**The sole role of ASV is to make an Option*judgable under the stated context*.**

---

### 3-A | Attestation (Contextual Stance)

**Action**

- Attestors submit signed attestations
    
    (not approval/disapproval, but *validity under this context*)
    

**Attestation Criteria**

- Consistency with the stated context
- Reusability (whether comparative judgement is possible)
- Sufficiency of information / absence of malicious intent

**Output**

- Attestation records
    
    (`endorse` / `needs-clarification` / `challenge`)
    

---

### 3-B | Request → Revision Loop

**Action**

- If information is insufficient or ambiguous, clarification is requested
- The Proposer revises or supplements and submits a new version

**Output**

- Option v1, v2, …
- Context v1, v2, …
- ASV history (append-only / irreversible)

**State Transition**

- Option: `Proposed → Refined`

---

### Step 4 | Option Fixation (Best-for-Now)

**Conditions**

- A defined proportion of ASV participants (e.g., 70%)
    
    agree that the Option is “best for now”
    
- Outstanding challenges have been resolved

**Action**

- The Option is **fixed as a working premise**

**Output**

- Locked Option (Best-for-now)
- Fixed hash / version

**State**

- Option: `Attested (Judgable)`

> This is not a “correct answer,”
> 
> 
> but **the most thoroughly observed premise at the current point in time**.
> 

---

### Step 5 | Reference / Selection

**Action**

- Observers, Initiators, or Forkers may compare and select Options
- Selection or reference may also trigger a new DQ or Fork

**Input**

- Locked Option
- One’s own Context

**Output**

- Selection event
- Reference log

**State**

- Option: `Reused`

---

### Step 6 | Fork (Branching)

**Action**

- If the Option does not fit, a new DQ or Fork is created

**Input**

- Locked Option
- New context / assumptions

**Output**

- Forked Decision Question
- New Option graph

**State**

- Option: `Forked`

---

### Step 7 | Reuse / Impact Recording

**Measurement Points (Downstream Impact)**

- Whether an Option was:
    - referenced
    - selected
    - used as a fork origin
    - influential on statements or actions

**Output**

- Impact records
- Base data for reward distribution

---

## Option State Transitions (Summary)

```
Draft
 → Proposed
   → Refined
     → Attested (Judgable / Best-for-now)
       → Reused
       → Forked

```

---

## Branching Conditions

- **Insufficient information**
    
    → ASV request → revision loop
    
- **Context mismatch**
    
    → Fork
    
- **Contradictions / unexplored areas**
    
    → handled in a new DQ or Fork
    
    (past decisions are not overturned)
    

---

## Exceptional Flow (Gamification / Abuse Suspicion)

**Triggers**

- Low-substance Options
- Unnatural ASV chains
- Reward-driven malicious behavior

**Flow**

```
Flag
 → Case creation
   → Review (ASV-based examination)
     → Enforce (penalty / invalidation / reward revocation)

```

---

## What This Conceptual Flow Demonstrates

- **Decision Questions are the sole starting point**
- **ASV is a process for generating judgability**
- Fixation confirms premises, not correctness
- Refutation moves forward via **Fork**, not reversal
- PoX is a structure in which **meaning continuously updates while the past remains intact**

---

# **6. Conceptual Model**

**Decision-Graph–Based Experience Infrastructure**

---

## **0. Model Assumptions**

PoX:

- does not determine correct answers
- does not create hierarchies through voting or evaluation
- preserves experience not as conclusions, but as **premise structures that generate judgability**

Accordingly, PoX is:

- neither a **timeline** (chronological log), nor
- a **tree** (correct-branch structure),

but is designed as a **Decision Graph**.

This graph contains both:

- **Flow** (events over time), and
- **State** (structural conditions).

---

---

## **2. Core Entities**

### **① Decision Question (DQ)**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Origin point of Phase 0 / Phase 8

**Role**

- A question that articulates the uncertainty preventing action
- The starting point for generating and validating Options

**Properties**

- context-dependent
- unresolved
- does not demand a correct answer

A Decision Question is:

not a question to *obtain an answer*, but

a question to *generate judgable options*.

---

### **② Option**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Phase 0 → Phase 6

**Definition**

- A context-attached, experience-based option
    
    proposed in response to a Decision Question
    

**Key Point**

- An Option does not stand alone
- It must always be paired with Context

Option =

**“Under this Context, this choice was viable.”**

---

### **③ Context**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Attached at Option submission and refined through ASV

**Role**

- The set of premises under which judgement became possible
- The boundary of an Option’s validity

**Includes**

- constraints (time, capital, position)
- situational conditions (phase, environment)
- the decision-maker’s assumptions and intent

Context =

**the mechanism that prevents an Option from becoming a general claim.**

---

### **④ Attestation-style Validation (ASV)**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Phase 2 to Phase 6

**Definition**

- A signed, context-aware stance regarding an Option and its Context

What ASV does:

- does not determine correctness
- does not vote
- only expresses conditional validity

ASV =

**“Under this Context, I judge this Option to be valid.”**

---

### **⑤ Judgable / Best-for-now (Fixed State)**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Phase 6

**Meaning**

- The premises have been sufficiently observed via ASV
- The best-considered reference point at the current time

**Important**

- not an eternal truth
- not overturned
- counterarguments move forward via Fork

→ an act of **fixing premises**, not answers

---

### **⑥ Reuse / Select**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Phase 7

**What Happens**

- Third parties reference and compare Options
- Options may be adopted relative to one’s own context

※ Selection is not evaluation

※ This is the starting point of action

---

### **⑦ Fork**

**Position in the Flow**

→ Phase 8

**Definition**

- A new Decision Question generated by contextual mismatch or divergence

A Fork:

- does not negate the past
- carries “this didn’t fit” forward into the future

→ not refutation, but **branching**

---

## **3. Option Lifecycle**

| **State** | **Meaning in the Flow** |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Before proposal |
| Proposed | Option + Context submitted |
| Refined | Revised via ASV requests |
| Attested | Judgable / Best-for-now |
| Reused | Applied to action |
| Forked | Generates a new DQ |

**Important**

- Attested ≠ correct answer ❌
- Attested = judgable premise ⭕️

---

## **4. PoX’s Philosophy of “Validation”**

**What is fixed**

- the premises under which judgement held
- the history of attestations regarding them

**What is not fixed**

- universal truths
- forced conclusions for others

→

The past is preserved; the future can branch.

---

## **5. Mapping Between Flow and Model**

| **Flow** | **Model** |
| --- | --- |
| DQ creation | Decision Question |
| Option submission | Option + Context |
| ASV | Attestation |
| Fixation | Judgable / Best-for-now |
| Selection | Reuse |
| Mismatch | Fork |
| Continuation | Decision Graph |

---

## **6. Conceptual Model in One Sentence**

PoX is a **Decision Graph infrastructure** in which,

starting from a Decision Question,

contextualized Options are fixed as **judgable premises** through Attestation,

and continuously updated through **reuse and forking**.

---

## 8. Open Questions & Future Exploration

### Points Where Feedback Is Requested

We explicitly welcome **criticism, alternative framings, and observations from real-world operational perspectives** on the following points.

---

### 1. About Decision Questions

- **Can a Decision Question reasonably be considered a valid primitive (minimal unit) for experience-based decision-making?**
- Although a Decision Question is context-dependent and unresolved,
    
    can it still form a structure that withstands reuse and comparison?
    
- What level of abstraction or concreteness is appropriate for a Decision Question?

---

### 2. About ASV (Attestation-style Validation)

- Does ASV, as designed,
    
    **truly avoid the dynamics of evaluation, ranking, and hierarchy?**
    
- Does the use of signed attestations risk introducing implicit authority or concentration of influence?
- How minimal can the ASV schema (required fields) realistically be reduced?

---

### 3. Context Description Cost and Practicality

- Does the cost of describing and updating Context
    
    become excessive in real-world operation?
    
- To what extent should Context be structured,
    
    and where should it be left to free-form human description?
    
- Can insufficient Context truly be compensated for through ASV?

---

### 4. Conditions for Forking and Preservation of Meaning

- Does Fork function as a **healthy form of branching**,
    
    or can it devolve into avoidance or fragmentation?
    
- If Forks continue to accumulate,
    
    can the Decision Graph maintain readability and navigability?
    
- Under what conditions does the assumption
    
    that “meaning is not destroyed by Forks” break down?
    

---

### 5. Downstream Impact and Incentives

- Do Reuse, Fork, and impact records
    
    accurately reflect the consequences of actions?
    
- Can impact metrics coexist with PoX’s non-ranking philosophy?
- Could incentive design distort ASV behavior or Fork dynamics?

---

### 6. Where This Model Breaks

- **Under what use cases, scales, or participant compositions does this model fail?**
- Which domains of decision-making is PoX fundamentally unsuited for?
- In what cases should PoX explicitly *not* be used?
- While PoX is currently conceived as an all-in platform,
    
    would coexistence with other sharing layers be preferable?
    

---

## Future Exploration

- Minimal viable schema for ASV
- Quantification methods for downstream impact
- Incentive design (reward sources and distribution)
- Anti-gaming mechanisms and enforcement depth
- On-chain / off-chain boundaries

---

## 9. Status

PoX is currently in a **conceptual exploration phase**.

This document presents a **working hypothesis** on how

**experience-based decision-making** might be structured and shared

without collapsing into “correct answers” or a single authoritative solution.

While the conceptual flow, core entities, and non-goals are intentionally specified,

details regarding protocol design, implementation strategies,

and incentive mechanisms are **deliberately left undecided**.

At this stage, the primary objective is **not implementation**, but to:

- examine the assumptions underlying this model,
- identify where it may break down, and
- clarify the boundary between where it is applicable and where it is not.

Accordingly, **critical feedback, alternative interpretations, and practical counterexamples**

are strongly encouraged.
